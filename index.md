# Intro

A quest manager or quest system is a part of the video game development where you control the storyline and the progression of the chracter
in your game. It can get very simple or very complex, that is why you want to know how the story and the progression of your game very clear,
so the desing process of the system gets simplified and avoid overcomplicated system desing.

## Writing

Before start writing, the best aproach is to set what are the main parts the storyline, then add some related secondary quests to have a 
general feeling of the game storyline.

Stories must be crafted in such a way as to seamlessly integrate different medium forms. If done right, viewers forget theyâ€™re reading text, 
listening to sound effects, looking at visuals and scrolling down all at the same time and begin to experience it as a whole.
Each form contributes a different and new piece of information and ties in naturally with the rest of elements.

## Progression

The quests order and connections will define how the game progresses and evolves. 
There are diferent aproaches to develope the progression of an interactive story, we can have 


### Lineal Progression

For lineal progression stories the quests are consecutive and dont have a complex code to handle events and keep track of the progress.
Is very straight forward, one quest after another, even having secondary quest available on each point of the story, not infuencing the main progress.

So at this point we should have decided what type of progression our game will have.
