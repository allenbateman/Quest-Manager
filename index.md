A quest manager or quest system is a part of the video game development where you control the storyline and the progression of the chracter
in your game. It can get very simple or very complex, that is why you want to know how the story and the progression of your game very clear,
so the desing process of the system gets simplified and avoid overcomplicated system desing.

## Writing

Before start writing, the best aproach is to set what main parts the storyline, then add some related secondary quests to have a 
general feling of the game storyline. This is usually better with a graphic representation.

Stories must be crafted in such a way as to seamlessly integrate different medium forms. If done right, viewers forget theyâ€™re reading text, 
listening to sound effects, looking at visuals and scrolling down all at the same time and begin to experience it as a whole.
Each form contributes a different and new piece of information and ties in naturally with the rest of elements.

## Progression

The quests order and connections will define how the game progresses and evolves.
